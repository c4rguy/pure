However! Savage was actually not as involved as people think, extra contect was added by Essence owners: 'Id like to clarify that savage wasn't really apart of Lunas raid, he was asleep and came back online after it finished. I'd also like to mention just yesterday he informed me that he was sorry had no idea I was scammed out of money THEN raided and that he plans to stop hanging out with lxzp.
